The fabric quality is really good and helps to keep your backpack safe from water (while travelling in light to mild rains) and from dust (when just storing the bag in house). Quality feels premium to touch and it is big enough to accomodate/cover larger backpacks as well (meant for 17"" laptop backpacks too). Amazon inHouse brands like AmazonBasics, Solimo etc. have a good reputation of being reliable, cost effective and of good quality as well overall making it a valueForMoney for customers. The dust cover utself comes in a nice little pouch which can then be used separately to keep items like wallet+charger+cord in it as an added protection from water hazards while travelling with it. The dust cover has a clip at the back too to keep it firmly covered and inPlace to provide optimum protection either travelling or storing your backpacks in the house.\n\n', ""\n\n  I bought this rain cover on Amazon to protect my 30L capacity laptop bag from moderate rain (not from heavy rain).We should keep bag tightly for our back inorder to avoid water logging at bottom and use along with umbrella â˜”!1. I will prefer this for employees, college students who may face sudden rain during their busy days!Not recommended For heavy rain!2. It's looks good and I will update my review later after a month use!3. Travellers can use this while walking along with umbrella and can use this to cover 30L ðŸ›„ while bike riding!I have uploaded all detailed images including super macro for stitching!\n\n"", '\n\n  This is good fabric quality with a buckle strap to hold bag in place. Got it for Rs 99 but now either out of stock or for Rs 209.\n\n', '\n\n  This rain and dust bag cover is good for people who have to travel often, especially in bikes. It suits most normal bags. Please remember that the shoulder strap part of the bag will be exposed to rain, though the chance of water entering through that part is very low. This product will definitely help, since you you will be able to wear smaller raincoats which cannot cover your bag.\n\n', ""\n\n  For thr price you're paying, this product does it's job and it does it well!Water resistance is decent even in Mumbai rains. Quality of the material is strictly okay. The SOLIMO branding has almost come off after two weeks of use in Mumbai rains.It is a good option to use while travelling on your two-wheeler.The attached buckle/clasp which is used to fasten the cover tight onto the bag so that the cover doesn't slip off is something worth noting.Additionally a water proof pouch is also provided to store the product.All in all definitely a value for money buy!\n\n"", '\n\n  Best product from Amazon. Totally paisa asul. Fitted with all bags.\n\n', '\n\n  Sufficiently large in size, can accommodate a 40 lts capacity bag as I have shown in the pictures. But if you wear the backpack it under heavy rains for a long time, water will seep through the gap between your back (body) and the backpack. This is not the fault of this product but an inevitable occurrence. To avoid that, you have to either avoid wearing the backpack on your back or use an umbrella or something. For example, if you need to ride, keep the bag on the pillion seat and tie it up.\n\n', '\n\n  Good thing1. Fits laptop bag perfectly. I purchased 40ltrs cover earlier, it was too big. This is the perfect size.2. Buckle makes the fitment even more perfectLimitation (no bad thing)1. Will be smaller for your travel/trekking bag\n\n', '\n\n  Bought it for F Gear President backpack. The fit is a bit tight. Tough to cover completely when the bag is full thouh.Quality is nice.Included pouch is useful to keep it organised.For mild rain it is good.Havenâ€™t gone under heavy rain yet.\n\n', '\n\n  I used to have bags that came with a cover like this, but it was a rarity in the past, and even now. Some bags are splash proof, but still not completely water proof, which means my things inside a bag could get wet. This cover ensures most of my things are safe and being easy to use, I would recommend this.\n\n']"

But this this time I was highly disappointed with the quality. I bought the large pack trusting it will be good but the gravy was totally watery. Also there should be chicken chunks in the gravy instead it was all mushy gooey stuff!Please be more vigilant during QC guys.. otherwise you will loose your customers! Attaching the pictures for all to see.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have a one and half years old Spitz and I give her home cooked food as well as ready made food. Just to diversify her diet, I bought this for her. Well, now every time she sees this in her bowl, she starts wagging her tail, which means she has liked it.. I have given her both chicken and the mutton variant and she is enjoying both. Looks like it's easy on her tummy too... Good product\n\n"", '\n\n  I was feeding my puppy kennel kitchen wet food limited ingredients diet with pumpkin. At first I was quite apprehensive about this as this was marketed as cheaper product. After buying this I learned that it is as good as the limited ingredient one .\n\n', '\n\n  The product says the ingredients are real chicken and lamb. However looking at the back of the packages they also contain fish and shellfish. Shellfish can cause allergic reactions in dogs and humans. Some people may actually have such severe reactions by even touching the shellfish.Quite unsafe not to report this on the page.\n\n', '\n\n  My dog loves it.I do mix it with rice when I feed him.The smell may not appeal to humans but dogs seem to think its divine\n\n', ""\n\n  I have been giving kennel kitchen chicken and lamb in gravy to my dog for over an year now. He loves the flavour and the quantity is fair. However, this time half of the sachets had very less chicken or lamb content. So less that i had to give two sachets at once to satisfy my dog's hunger.\n\n"", ""\n\n  The quantity is very small, and the amount of chunks is also low. There's not much gravy. Stinks badly. My dog ate it but was still hungry and unsatisfied.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have a beagle of 6 months old..She didnt eat this... She doest even like this.Dont know exactly whether the food is not good or she doesnt like this...\n\n', '\n\n  My Puppy : 7 months old didnâ€™t  even taste it. Totally wasted my money . The consistency of the product doesnâ€™t elicit confidence that itâ€™s a safe and well made product.\n\n', '\n\n  This is not suitable for puppies, because the pieces are so big and hard then compared the Pedigree puppy gravy. Pedigree puppy gravy is better than Kennel Kitchen.\n\n']"
